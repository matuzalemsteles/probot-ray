# Ray bot

> A GitHub application created with [probot](https://github.com/probot/probot) that automatically labels issues with the label in-progress when an open PR uses the [GitHub issue keywords](https://help.github.com/articles/closing-issues-using-keywords/), the same happens when a PR is closed add label done when reference to the issues and adds a comment thanking.

## How it works

When you use [github keywords](https://help.github.com/articles/closing-issues-using-keywords/) like `fixes`,` resolves`, `closes` and other variants in a PR, the bot automatically adds `in-progress` label to issues referenced in the PR.

This probot still adds the label `done` when the PR is closed and a thank you message.
